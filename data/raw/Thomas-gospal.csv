"Jesus said, ""Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel,  and will rule over all."""
"Jesus said, ""If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the Father's imperial rule is in the sky,' then the birds of the sky will precede you.  If they say to you, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you.  Rather, the Father's imperial rule is inside you and outside you.  When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father.  But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty."""
"Jesus said, ""The person old in days won't hesitate to ask a little child seven days old about the place of life, and that person will live.  For many of the first will be last,  and will become a single one."""

"His disciples asked him and said to him, ""Do you want us to fast? How should we pray? Should we give to charity? What diet should we observe?""  Jesus said, ""Don't lie,  and don't do what you hate,  because all things are disclosed before heaven.  After all, there is nothing hidden that won't be revealed,  and there is nothing covered up that will remain undisclosed."""
"Jesus said, ""Lucky is the lion that the human will eat, so that the lion becomes human.  And foul is the human that the lion will eat, and the lion still will become human."""
"And he said, ""The human one is like a wise fisherman who cast his net into the sea and drew it up from the sea full of little fish.  Among them the wise fisherman discovered a fine large fish.  He threw all the little fish back into the sea, and easily chose the large fish.  Anyone here with two good ears had better listen!"""
"Jesus said, Look, the sower went out, took a handful of seeds, and scattered them.  Some fell on the road, and the birds came and gathered them.  0thers fell on rock, and they didn't take root in the soil and didn't produce heads of grain.  Others fell on thorns, and they choked the seeds and worms ate them.  And others fell on good soil, and it produced a good crop"
"Jesus said, ""I have cast fire upon the world, and look, I'm guarding it until it blazes."""
"Jesus said, ""This heaven will pass away, and the one above it will pass away.  The dead are not alive, and the living will not die.  During the days when you ate what is dead, you made it come alive. When you are in the light, what will you do?  0n the day when you were one, you became two. But when you become two, what will you do?"""

"Jesus said to his disciples, ""Compare me to something and tell me what I am like.""  Simon Peter said to him, ""You are like a just angel.""  Matthew said to him, ""You are like a wise philosopher.""  Thomas said to him, ""Teacher, my mouth is utterly unable to say what you are like.""   Jesus said, ""I am not your teacher. Because you have drunk, you have become intoxicated from the bubbling spring that I have tended.""  And he took him, and withdrew, and spoke three sayings to him.  When Thomas came back to his friends, they asked him, ""What did Jesus say to you?""  Thomas said to them, ""If I tell you one of the sayings he spoke to me, you will pick up rocks and stone me, and fire will come from the rocks and devour you."""
"Jesus said to them, ""If you fast, you will bring sin upon yourselves,  and if you pray, you will be condemned,  and if you give to charity, you will harm your spirits.  When you go into any region and walk about in the countryside, when people take you in, eat what they serve you and heal the sick among them.  After all, what goes into your mouth won't defile you; what comes out of your mouth will."""
"Jesus said, ""When you see one who was not born of woman, fall on your faces and worship. That one is your Father."""
"Jesus said, ""Perhaps people think that I have come to cast peace upon the world.  They do not know that I have come to cast conflicts upon the earth: fire, sword, war.  For there will be five in a house: there'll be three against two and two against three, father against son and son against father,  and they will stand alone."""
"Jesus said, ""I will give you what no eye has seen, what no ear has heard, what no hand has touched, what has not arisen in the human heart."""
"The disciples said to Jesus, ""Tell us, how will our end come?""  Jesus said, ""Have you found the beginning, then, that you are looking for the end? You see, the end will be where the beginning is.  Congratulations to the one who stands at the beginning: that one will know the end and will not taste death."""
"Jesus said, ""Congratulations to the one who came into being before coming into being.  If you become my disciples and pay attention to my sayings, these stones will serve you.  For there are five trees in Paradise for  you; they do not change, summer or winter, and their leaves do not fall.  Whoever knows them will not taste death."""
"The disciples said to Jesus, ""Tell us what Heaven's imperial rule is like.""  He said to them, It's like a mustard seed.  It's the smallest of all seeds,  but when it falls on prepared soil, it produces a large branch and becomes a shelter for birds of the sky."
"Mary said to Jesus, ""What are your disciples like?""  He said, They are like little children living in a field that is not theirs.  When the owners of the field come, they will say, ""Give us back our field.""  They take off their clothes in front of them in order to give it back to them, and they return their field to them.  For this reason I say, if the owners of a house know that a thief is coming, they will be on guard before the thief arrives, and will not let the thief break into their house their domain and steal their possessions.  As for you, then, be on guard against the world.  Prepare yourselves with great strength, so the robbers can't find a way to get to you, for the trouble you expect will come.  Let there be among you a person who understands. When the crop ripened, he came quickly carrying a sickle and harvested it. Anyone here with two good ears had better listen!"
"Jesus saw some babies nursing.  He said to his disciples, ""These nursing babies are like those who enter the Father's domain.""  They said to him, ""Then shall we enter the Father's domain as babies?""  Jesus said to them, ""When you make the two into one, and when you make the inner like the outer and the outer like the inner, and the upper like the lower,  and when you make male and female into a single one, so that the male will not be male nor the female be female,  when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image,  then you will enter the Father's domain."""
"Jesus said, ""I shall choose you, one from a thousand and two from ten thousand,  and they will stand as a single one."""
"His disciples said, ""Show us the place where you are, for we must seek it.""  He said to them, ""Anyone here with two ears had better listen!  There is light within a person of light, and it shines on the whole world. If it does not shine, it is dark."""
"Jesus said, ""Love your friends like your own soul,  protect them like the pupil of your eye."""
"Jesus said, ""You see the sliver in your friend's eye, but you don't see the timber in your own eye.  When you take the timber out of your own eye, then you will see well enough to remove the sliver from your friend's eye."
"""If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the Father's domain.  If you do not observe the sabbath day as a sabbath day, you will not see the Father."""
"Jesus said, ""I took my stand in the midst of the world, and in flesh I appeared to them.  I found them all drunk, and I did not find any of them thirsty.  My soul ached for the children of humanity, because they are blind in their hearts and do not see, for they came into the world empty, and they also seek to depart from the world empty. 'But meanwhile they are drunk. When they shake off their wine, then they will change their ways."""
"Jesus said, ""If the flesh came into being because of spirit, that is a marvel,  but if spirit came into being because of the body, that is a marvel of marvels.  Yet I marvel at how this great wealth has come to dwell in this poverty."""

"Jesus said, ""What you will hear in your ear, in the other ear proclaim from your rooftops.  After all, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket, nor does one put it in a hidden place. 'Rather, one puts it on a lampstand so that all who come and go will see its light."""

"His disciples said, ""When will you appear to us, and when will we see you?""  Jesus said, ""When you strip without being ashamed, and you take your clothes and put them under your feet like little children and trample them,  then you will see the son of the living one and you will not be afraid."""
"Jesus said, ""Often you have desired to hear these sayings that I am speaking to you, and you have no one else from whom to hear them.  There will be days when you will seek me and you will not find me."""
"Jesus said, ""The Pharisees and the scholars have taken the keys of knowledge and have hidden them.  They have not entered, nor have they allowed those who want to enter to do so.  As for you, be as sly as snakes and as simple as doves."""

"Jesus said, ""Be passersby."""
"His disciples said to him, ""Who are you to say these things to us?""  ""You don't understand who I am from what I say to you.  Rather, you have become like the Judeans, for they love the tree but hate its fruit, or they love the fruit but hate the tree."""
"Jesus said, ""Whoever blasphemes against the Father will be forgiven,  and whoever blasphemes against the son will be forgiven, abut whoever  blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven."""
"Jesus said, ""Grapes are not harvested from thorn trees, nor are figs gathered from thistles, for they yield no fruit.  Good persons produce good from what they've stored up;  bad persons produce evil from the wickedness they've stored up in their hearts, and say evil things. 'For from the overflow of the heart they produce evil."""
"Jesus said, ""From Adam to John the Baptist, among those born of women, no one is so much greater than John the Baptist that his eyes should not be averted.  But I have said that whoever among you becomes a child will recognize the Father's imperial rule and will become greater than John."""
"Jesus said, ""A person cannot mount two horses or bend two bows.  And a slave cannot serve two masters, otherwise that slave will honor the one and offend the other.  ""Nobody drinks aged wine and immediately wants to drink young wine.  Young wine is not poured into old wineskins, or they might break, and aged wine is not poured into a new wineskin, or it might spoil.  An old patch is not sewn onto a new garment, since it would create a tear."""

"Jesus said, ""Whoever has come to know the world has discovered a carcass,  and whoever has discovered a carcass, of that person the world is not worthy."""
"Jesus said, The Father's imperial rule is like a person who had good seed.  His enemy came during the night and sowed weeds among the good seed.  The person did not let the workers pull up the weeds, but said to them, ""No, otherwise you might go to pull up the weeds and pull up the wheat along with them.""

"Jesus said, Someone was receiving guests. When he had prepared the dinner, he sent his slave to invite the guests. The slave went to the first and said, ""My master invites you."" The first replied, ""Some merchants owe me money; they are coming to me tonight. I have to go and give them instructions. Please excuse me from dinner."" The slave went to another and said, ""My master has invited you."" The second said to the slave, ""I have bought a house, and I have been called away for a day. I shall have no time."" The slave went to another and said, ""My master invites you."" The third said to the slave, ""My friend is to be married, and I am to arrange the banquet. I shall not be able to come. Please excuse me from dinner."" The slave went to another and said, ""My master invites you."" The fourth said to the slave, ""I have bought an estate, and I am going to collect the rent.
